ps (terminal command)

The “ps” (process status) is used to display information about the active processes that are currently running for the user. 

This command is typically used with a flag (or combination of flags) to filter the list of displayed processes. 

usually, one line is displayed for each process.
  
To display all processes:

ps -a

To display a long list with extensive information about the processes:

ps -l

To display a list sorted by memory usage:

ps -m 

To display every running process along with details about PID (process ID), elapsed running time, etc:

ps -ax

if a combination of flags is used, the list will contain all the processes that match at least one of the flags.

There are, of course, many other flags and possible combinations to filter the displayed list.
