mv (terminal command)

The “mv” command is used to move files or directories from one location to another in the file system.

The basic syntax for the “mv” command is:

mv [source] [target]

source = file_name.file_type / directory_name
target = file_name.file_type / directory_name

for example:

mv example_file ~/example_file

The "mv" command can also be used to rename files or directories:

mv example_file example_file_2

Note that using the “mv” command requires having “write” permission for both the source and the target files/directories.

If  a file is moved to a location where there already is another file with the same name, the latter will be over-written by the former (unless the -n flag is used which will prevent over-writing; the -f flag can be used to “force” over-writing without asking the user for confirmation). 

The -v (verbose) flag can be used to show the file/directory after the mv command is executed.
