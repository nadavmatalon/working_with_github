grep (terminal command) -

The “grep command” is used for searching the content of one or more files by matching them with user specified content, including regular expressions.

The basic syntax is as follows:

grep “string_to_look_for” text_file_to_look_in.txt


The -r flag can be used to search for matching patterns in subfolders. for example:

grep -r Apple ~/Documents/* 

will find “Apple” in any file in any subfolder of ~/Documents


The -l flag can be used to limit the search to file names only, for example:

grep -l Orange

will only return the files who’s name contains “Orange” in the location where the command was executed.

The -i flag makes the grep search case-insensitive, for example:

grep -i rain 

will return matching results for “rain”, “Rain”, “RAIN”, etc.
