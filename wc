wc (terminal command)

Genrally speaking, the “wc” command returns the number of characters, words, or lines in a specified file.

(a line is defined as a string which ends with the “ new line” (\n) delimiter).

To count the number of characters in a file:

wc -c [text_file]

To count the number of words in a file:

wc -w [text_file]

To count the number of lines in a file:

wc -l [text_file]

The “wc” can also be used in conjunction with the “ls” (list) command to count the number of files (or files of a particular kind) in a directory.

For example, to count the number of txt files in a directory:

ls -l *.txt | wc -l
